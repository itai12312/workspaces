2. by using genetic algorithm and neural network

graphic visualzation

programming-not relavent, done in english
shortcuts-do when press "ctrl" will temporarly revert to old keyboard,not relavent
finger travel
hand alteration
same finger frequency
%of words, letters-freq in home row,if having to reach out for frequent letters
how easy is is to type frequent bigrams(2-letter combinations)
captalization-not relavent

more stuff:
Movement on the Keyboard
The home keys (not necessarily the home row) are the place to be
Vertical movement between the columns (reaching and folding) are not necessarily strenuous on the fingers and wrists because it is more natural for the fingers to fold or stretch vertically than horizontally
Side-to-side movements are more strenuous for the wrists than up and down motion
Diagonally reaching for the top and bottom middle keys are the worst
Fingers
Index Finger: very strong, short
Middle Finger: strong, very long
Ring Finger: weak, long
Pinky Finger: weak, short

Most of these seem obvious enough but it helps to jot them down for clarity. I then came up with a set of principles to serve as guidelines to help me with the design:

Prioritize the home keys
If vertical folding and reaching cannot be prevented, prioritize reaching for longer fingers and folding for shorter fingers.
Place more frequent keys under stronger fingers
Common bigrams should be easy to type.
